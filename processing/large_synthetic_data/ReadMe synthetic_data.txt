# parameter: numUsers2generate provides the number of users to generate and can be changed. 

# the data include numUsers2generate users, with a period one month. (file LargeSyntheticData.csv contains 2500 users)

# for one day of each user, a trajectory may or may not be generated, with a probability of 0.13 (4 trajectories per user per month as found from real data)

# if a trajectory needs to be generated, it is randomly pulled from a pool of two trajectories.

# the two trajectories are manually created, one having 3 trips and the other one having 2 trips.

Codes for processing app-based data were coded and tested using anaconda2-4.2.0

I did realize that if outputs shall be different if the environment is not anaconda2-4.2.0

I tried to identify which package made a difference but failed. 

Anyone of the three requirement files should works.

These files are exported from Hyak.

I successfully built my docker using spec-file_anaconda2-4.2.0.txt 

To make a mini docker image, you could choose a part of packages in the requirement.
